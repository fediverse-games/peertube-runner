# peertube-runner-docker
Peertube Runner in Docker!

I couldn't quite find an image that did *exactly* what I wanted so I decided to create my own.

TO DO:

- Proper documentation.
- Better github build process.
- Publish to dockerhub?
- Try and get hardware acceleration working (may require changes to the peertube-runner package itself).
